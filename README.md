#Would you rather app
Would you rather is an app built with Reactjs & Redux where a user answers questions based on two options given. 

The application consists of six pages.
  1. **Login Page** : The Login Page consists of a login form. Choose a user to access the features of the app.
  2. **Home Page** : The page shows two tabs of Unanswered & Answered questions. Unanswered questions are shown by default and the user can alternate between the two tabs.
  3. **Question Page** : The Question Page consists of a question form. The user can choose one option to answer the question.
  4. **Results Page** : The Result Page shoes the poll results.
  5. **Add Question Page** : This page consists of a form for an authenticated user to create a new poll.
    6. **Leaderboard Page** : Users are ordered in descending order based on the sum of the number of questions they’ve answered and the number of questions they’ve asked.

The app contains a navigation bar that is visible on all of the pages. The user can navigate between the page for creating new polls, and the leaderboard page, and the home page without typing the address into the address bar.
